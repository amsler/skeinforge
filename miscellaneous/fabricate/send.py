Usage:	send [options] <filename or gcode> [<filename or gcode>...] 
	--verbose : Verbose - print ALL communication, not just comments.
	       -v : prints responses from the arduino, and every command sent.

	--quiet   : Quiet - don't print anything, whereas
	       -q : normally comments are printed.

	--noreset : skip the reset.
	       -n : causes the arduino to not be deliberately reset.

	--port    : Set the port to write to
	       -p : default is "/dev/ttyUSB0" for posix, "COM3" for windows.

You may call this with either a single statement of g-code
to be sent to the arduino, or with the name of a g-code file.
