Viewpoint move is a mouse tool to move the viewpoint in the xy plane.

When the mouse is clicked and dragged on the canvas, viewpoint move will drag the scroll pane accordingly.  If the shift key is also pressed, the scroll pane will be moved only in the x or y direction, whichever is largest.

When the viewpoint move tool is chosen and the canvas has the focus, viewpoint move will listen to the arrow keys.  Clicking in the canvas gives the canvas the focus, and when the canvas has the focus a thick black border is drawn around the canvas.  When the right arrow key is pressed, viewpoint move will move the scroll pane to the right by a pixel.  When the left arrow key is pressed, the scroll pane will be moved a pixel to the left.  The up arrow key moves the scroll pane a pixel up and the down arow key moves the scroll pane a pixel down.
